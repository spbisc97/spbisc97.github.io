# Personal site

This repo powers your GitHub Pages site. To make it yours:

- Update the copy in `index.html` (name, bio, projects, contact links, email).
- Adjust the accent colors and font choices at the top of the `<style>` block.
- If you add assets (images, resume PDF), place them in an `assets/` folder and update the links.
- Commit and push to `main`; GitHub Pages will redeploy automatically.
