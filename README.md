# Personal site

Static GitHub Pages site for Simone Rotondi.

Structure
- `index.html` – home (hero, about, selected work, now, contact).
- `projects.html` – detailed project writeups.
- `brainjuice.html` – BrainJuice/BrainJuiceClub overview and notes placeholders.
- `assets/css/styles.css` – shared styles (accent color lives in `:root`).
- `assets/img/` – add your own images; includes a small placeholder.

Quick customization
- Update emails, social links, and project URLs in the HTML files.
- Swap copy for your bio, timelines, and BrainJuice notes.
- Change the accent color in `assets/css/styles.css` (`--accent` in `:root`).
- Replace `assets/img/placeholder-card.png` and add a profile photo at `assets/img/profile.jpg`.

Deploy
- Commit and push to `main`; GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically for this repo.
